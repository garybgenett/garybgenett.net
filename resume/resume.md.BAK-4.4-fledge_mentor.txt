My primary objective as a mentor would be to help new entrepreneurs find their path to their vision.

I have 15 years experience guiding executive leadership towards their mission and goals, with a focus on the supporting business models and profitable execution.  I started and ran my own small business for two years, including acquiring the operation of another company and successfully merging it into the unified processes and direction of the company.  I structured the business as a corporation, and know how to incorporate and manage the additional requirements of a shareholding organization.
