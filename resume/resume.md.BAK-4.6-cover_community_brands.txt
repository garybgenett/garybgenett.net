==========

There is an emerging trend in information technology to contribute to the common good, which I would like to see more of from an industry whose founding tenets are continual progress and problem-solving.  Finding companies to work for who embrace this, in whole or in part, is not an easy undertaking.

For the last two years I've been running my own company, because I wanted to contribute and have the ability to empower those less fortunate than me by providing job opportunities, training and livable wages.  It was a rewarding experience, but one which was costing me my health as a one-man small business in the extreme economics of the Seattle area.

I'm moving back into the technology industry, which I have enjoyed working in for almost 20 years.  The innovation, collaboration and feeling of participation in the advancement of the human race have called to me during my time investing in another endeavor.  I'm looking to join a company with a focus on giving back as much or more than it receives.

Community Brands clearly exceeds this bar, and I would love the opportunity to serve as a member of the team.  I feel that your company can fully utilize the range of skills I have developed throughout my technology and business career.

I enjoy innovating and problem solving immensely, and environments where I am able to bring the whole of what I have to offer is where I thrive.  Community Brands seems to be genuinely invested in a culture of cooperation and mutual exchange, not just internally among the team, but with the world of socially-minded organizations it engages as well.  Those values resonate deeply with me.  The way forward is together, if we really want to get the job done.

Our world needs quite a bit right now, to create a truly global community that supports and nourishes everyone, and Community Brands is working hard towards that vision on all the fronts it can.  It would be wonderful to contribute to that effort, and I'd like to explore if I can step in to do that with you.
