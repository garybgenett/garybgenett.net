Hiring Manager for #150675001: Technical Program Manager, Cloud Architect, Cloud Platform,

After leading cross-functional projects at F5 for over 10 years, I'm ready to apply the experience I've gained in a new way.  I think my expertise driving complex projects, along with the thought leadership I bring, could help your team move into new frontiers.  My ability to go from a high-level executive briefing into a geeky discussion with skilled engineers equips me to provide unique value while we roll up our sleeves and get the job done.

I see the exemplary work Google is doing as a corporate citizen while leading the industry.  You have a great reputation as both a company and an employer.  I'd love to join your team and "do cool things that matter," as your recent campaign so aptly put it.

I'm interested in learning more about this role, and welcome the chance to talk about it over the phone or in-person.

-- Gary
