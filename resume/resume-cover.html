<p>Throughout my career, I have established a reputation as a transformational leader who is driven by challenge, undeterred by obstacles, and committed to exceeding expectations. My expertise encompasses all aspects of the product management lifecycle, from ideation and scope definition through to the final delivery, according to stakeholder requirements.

Furthermore, I possess experience in mergers and acquisitions, with technical proficiency in cloud architecture and automation. My track record of success has been reinforced by establishing top-performing staff teams and encouraging professional growth at all levels. Through sound decision making and leadership, I have aided past employers, including Alaska Airlines, Enviro-Master, and F5 Networks in achieving short- and long-range goals. If given the opportunity, I will work tirelessly to deliver similar results for [COMPANY].</p>
<p>Over the course of my professional history, I have achieved the following career highlights:</p>

<p>Over the course of my professional history, I have achieved the following acquisition highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was the cross-functional business/technical point on 3 acquisitions at F5 Networks, running the full process from due diligence to completed integration, which in all cases required significant work on the culture and technology sides
<ul>
<li>Each was a start-up with very different and entrenched ways of operating the business, and in two cases were based internationally, which brought additional challenges</li>
<li>In all cases, we successfully integrated their technology offerings into the core suite, and also were able to get their buy-in to merge into our established operational practices</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At Alaska AIrlines, I worked to help close the final gaps with the major acquisition/merger of/with Virgin Air, which included consolidation of datacenters, antiquation and/or migration of legacy applications, and a move from enterprise hosting in a waterfall environment to a cloud-based DevOps model

<ul>
<li>I operated with 100% responsibility and 0% authority, which required advocacy and influence to get both stakeholder and developer support</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I have 10+ years of experience at F5, which grew from $500M to $2B during that time, working directly at the executive level to evangelize best-practices and support profitable decision-making</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>In me, [COMPANY] will gain a diligent, goal-oriented professional with the agility, dedication, and focus required to successfully fill the role of [POSITION]. As such, I would welcome the opportunity to meet in person and discuss this opening in detail.</p>
