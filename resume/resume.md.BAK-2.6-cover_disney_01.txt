Disney Hiring Manager,

After leading cross-functional projects and development teams at F5 for over 10 years, I'm ready to apply the experience I've gained in new ways.  My expertise is in transforming abstract visions into concrete actions that deliver results, and I'm ready to bring this to the Disney team.  The ability to go from a high-level executive briefing into a geeky discussion with skilled engineers equips me to provide unique value while we roll up our sleeves and get the job done.

I see the exemplary work Disney is doing across a multitude of entertainment markets and the fearless utilization of next-generation technologies to accomplish your goals.  You have a solid reputation as both a company and an employer, and I'd love to join your team and be a part of the decades-long tradition.

I'm interested in learning more about this role, and welcome the chance to talk about it over the phone or in-person.
