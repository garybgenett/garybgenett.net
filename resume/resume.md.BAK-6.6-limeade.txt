What drew you to Limeade and why?
It is an emerging trend that companies are realizing what a precious and critical resource their employees are, and are demonstrating this through action and not just words on their website.  I believe this ongoing shift has, and will continue to have, a positive impact in both the workforce and our wider culture.  Happy people perform better, and put more energy into their work and efforts beyond their own lives and into the lives of others.
Organizations are more likely to continue down these paths if they have the tools and processes necessary to support that, and being able to help deliver on the Limeade mission would be in direct alignment with my own values.

Provide an example of a time you've demonstrated excellence in work or life.
In my current role at Alaska Airlines, I have only had a few months to assess and transform their environment management processes, centralize and update their documentation, and help move them towards antiquation of post-merger systems as they migrate from legacy applications to the cloud.
My contract is not yet complete, and already I have exceeded the agreed commitments, and have delivered a new set of policies and procedures, along with documentation templates, that the team has already begun validating and adopting.
