Brian,

I'm looking forward to speaking with you tomorrow, hopefully in person.  
A significant portion of communication is non-verbal, and it is my 
desire to have the opportunity to get a deeper sense of you 
professionally and as a person in evaluating this potential fit.

I believe very strongly that the human race needs to become space-bound, 
as a matter of both principle and survival.  As the most intelligent 
species we are aware of, it is our moral responsibility to continue our 
existence, increase our understanding of our universe, and expand our 
physical explorations into it.  It is no longer feasible or prudent to 
remain solely on this single planet, our birthplace and home.  In this 
vein, I keep up as much as I can with the constant advances in both 
theoretical physics and the recent developments in the young but 
evolving aerospace industry.

I have been engaged professionally with software development for over 15 
years.  I've been very fortunate to work in many cross-functional roles 
surrounding that process, and have been party to many systems and 
paradigms, failures and successes.  I have direct experience building 
new teams, establishing vision and direction, and also stepping in 
half-way, seeing it through in both cases.  Talented developers are a 
unique group of people, creative yet logical and structured in their 
thought processes. Product Management is a vital role, guiding the 
results with a great deal of responsibility and generally little 
authority.  They must be excellent partners, communicators and 
cheerleaders. Without them, development teams go quickly astray, which I 
have seen first-hand.

With the technology market being what it is, my resume is very much 
tailored towards my software development experience.  For this role, it 
is important that my understanding of, and experience with, 
manufacturing and logistics also be mentioned. During my 5 years on the 
NPI team at F5, I had to be directly involved with the hardware NPIs.  
Our product was a custom-designed hardware platform which was driven by 
software, which created a powerful co-dependency.  Software generally 
moves at a whole different speed, and with a different culture, than 
hardware does.  Upstream dependencies, delivery and malfunctions had a 
huge impact.  Post-release issues in the field that could not be 
addressed with software were very challenging. Proliferation of types of 
components, versions of components, and different manufacturers were 
extremely complicated, as was our return and replacement program.  All 
the suppliers, shipping and receiving, pacing with the necessary areas 
of software development, not to mention keeping track of who is 
responsible for paying for what and making sure it happens, was a whole 
world unto itself.  Having run my own distribution company only 
furthered my experience, working with upstream redistributors who had 
different stocking cycles and inventory projection practices than my 
own, not to mention all the administrative work of shorted or delayed 
deliveries and returns for faulty or damaged product. I'm not a 
manufacturing or logistics expert by any stretch, but I am a proven 
quick study and am only demonstrating that I am not completely ignorant 
to the space.  The process of discovering and understanding the internal 
customer requirements will allow me to learn rapidly, by definition.

I'm very excited about this position, and the work Blue Origin is 
doing.  Rockets are not trendy software applications.  They take time, 
diligence, patience and tenacity.  They are a long game, with a big 
series of small wins that lead the way there.  The advertised philosophy 
and culture of your company resonate deeply with me, and I hope it is 
mutually reflected when we speak to each other tomorrow.

I can find a job and collect a paycheck anywhere, but only an 
organization with a mission like yours can provide the fulfillment and 
sense of contribution to humanity that I desire.  Serving a vision that 
is greater than the quarterly stock price is extremely important to me, 
and more rare than it should be in this day and age.
