I am a passionate technologist with a closet full of "different hats" I love wearing whenever I get the chance.  I've been in technology for quite a while, and have worked in every discipline through the entire product/delivery lifecycle, from pre-sales to launch and ongoing support.  I greatly enjoy working directly with customers, and all the fun, challenges and rewards that go with it.  I take being a face of the company seriously, and carry it with pride.

I enjoy working on projects of all sizes, am a zealous perfectionist, and excited by beautiful interfaces.  I'm looking for a home, preferably with a small, growing company committed to remembering to laugh along the way on the path to success.
