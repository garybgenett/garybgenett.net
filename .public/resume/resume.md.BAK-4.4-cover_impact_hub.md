Andrea & Peter,

I was referred to Impact Hub by one of your members, Rachel Van't Land, and have recently become a member myself.  Natalia toured the facility with me, and answered several of my questions regarding your goals and operation.

The internal message to members expressed a great need to find just the right person, and the position requires a dynamic and capable individual possessing a wide set of skills and experience.

I believe I can serve Impact Hub Seattle well in this role.

My career as a leader started in the hospitality industry, transitioned into a long and successful journey in information technology, and ultimately led to a business of my own over the last two years.  This range of experiences and the opportunities it provided required me to develop the rare combination you seek of management and business skills, running a multifaceted operation, while working with board and executive leadership to both learn and demonstrate strong initiative.

I enjoy innovating and problem solving immensely, and environments where I am able to bring the whole of what I have to offer is where I thrive.  Impact Hub Seattle seems to be genuinely invested in a culture of cooperation and mutual exchange, not just with the member community and the wider communities it engages, but internally among the team as well.  Those values resonate deeply with me.  The way forward is together, if we really want to get the job done.

Our world needs quite a bit right now, to create a truly global community that supports and nourishes everyone, and Impact Hub is working hard towards that vision.  It would be wonderful to contribute to that effort, and I'd like to explore if I can step in to do that with you.

-- Gary B. Genett
