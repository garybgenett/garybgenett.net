=old: zillow
After leading cross-functional projects at F5 for over 10 years, I'm ready to drive success with the team running the backbone of Zillow's business.  My expertise transforming abstract visions into concrete goals will enable me to contribute towards delivering the results that are needed.  I have the ability to analyze the geeky details that engineers live for and communicate them in terms of business value to an executive audience.  I'm most proud when the technology I've helped build enhances people's lives in some way.

Moving fast and thinking big, Spencer and the Zillow team have redefined visibility and what it means to have a sense of mission and contribution in the workplace.  I have a deep desire to jump in and own my part in bringing as much information as possible into the light for everyone to benefit from.  I want a seat on the bench of the team sport that is Zillow.

I think you will be very glad you spoke with me, so please contact me to schedule an interview as soon as possible.
