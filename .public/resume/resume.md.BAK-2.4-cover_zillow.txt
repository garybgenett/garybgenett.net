Hiring Manager for #opVh2fwn: Senior Program Manager - Personalization

After leading cross-functional projects at F5 for over 10 years, I'm ready to apply the experience I've gained in a new way.  I think my expertise driving complex projects, along with the thought leadership I bring, could help your team move into new frontiers.  My ability to go from a high-level executive briefing into a geeky discussion with skilled engineers equips me to provide unique value while we roll up our sleeves and get the job done.

I personally experienced the value Zillow brings during the home purchase process this last year.  You have a great reputation as both a company and an employer.  I'd love to join your team and contribute to the market-defining advances you are making.

I'm interested in learning more about this role, and welcome the chance to talk about it over the phone or in-person.
