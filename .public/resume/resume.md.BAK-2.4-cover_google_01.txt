Hiring Manager for #150675001: Technical Program Manager, Cloud Architect, Cloud Platform,

After over 10 years of experience leading cross-functional projects at my current company, I am ready for a new challenge.  I also see the exemplary job Google is doing as a corporate citizen and an industry leader, and was moved by a recent "do cool things that matter" advertisement which covered some of the worldwide contributions made recently.  It inspired me to pursue Google as my next employer.

I believe I may be a good fit in this role, given my expertise wrangling complex projects through thought leadership and influence.  Being able to go from an executive briefing on the high-level goals and status of a project directly into a lively discussion at the engineering level on how best to tackle the latest hurdle is not a daily transition many are willing to make, whereas I personally enjoy it and thrive on it.  For me, it makes for more interesting work, and a greater sense of accomplishment by being able to participate at all points throughout the project lifecycle.  It's very satisfying to me to see everyone and everything moving seamlessly in the same direction.

I'm very interested in learning more about this position at Google, so we can work together to determine if my filling this spot on the Google team would be the best way for us both to achieve our goals.  I'm eager to engage in phone and in-person discussions as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Gary B. Genett
