Hiring Manager for #58450: Sales Engineer

After leading cross-functional projects at F5 for over 10 years, I'm ready to apply the experience I've gained in a new way.  I think my expertise driving complex projects, along with the thought leadership I bring, could help your team move into new frontiers.  My ability to go from a high-level executive briefing into a geeky discussion with skilled engineers equips me to provide unique value while we roll up our sleeves and get the job done.

Fastly is making big waves in the CDN space, and has demonstrated skill at market assessment and engineering solid solutions.  I'd love to join your team and make big contributions to the constant redefinition of partnership and performance.

I'm interested in learning more about this role, and welcome the chance to talk about it over the phone or in-person.
