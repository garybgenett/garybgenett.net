Over the course of my career, I have established a reputation as an accomplished project leader who is skilled at steering implementations to success in a way that cultivates growth and maximizes profitability.  Furthermore, I am adept at exceeding targets and building professional client relationships.  My expertise encompasses the full project management lifecycle, from scope definition and initial planning to final delivery, to ensure on-time, on-budget, and on-target results.  Additionally, I possess experience and technical proficiency in implementation of new software deployments and systems integration.

I have aided past companies, including Alaska Airlines, Enviro-Master, and F5 Networks in achieving short- and long-range goals.  If given the opportunity, I will work diligently to deliver similar results for Infopro Learning in this project.  In me, you will gain a determined, strategic professional with the agility, dedication, and focus required to successfully execute this effort.

Since this is a smaller project with a short timeline, there is an opportunity for you to gain senior-level experience within your budget, which mutually gives me the opportunity to further grow my private practice.
