Disney Hiring Manager,

After leading cross-functional projects and development teams at F5 for over 10 years, I'm ready to apply the experience I've gained in new ways.  My expertise is in helping technical teams turn high-level visions into results that move both the product and the business forward.  I'm able to go from a high-level executive briefing into a geeky discussion with skilled engineers, which makes me a great asset to technical programs.

I'm inspired by the exemplary work Disney is doing across a multitude of entertainment markets using next-gen technologies, and by the way such a longstanding company continually stays relevant.  You have a solid reputation as both a company and an employer, and I'd love to join your team.

I'm interested in learning more about this role, and would welcome the chance to talk over the phone or in person to see if this might be a good fit.
