Hiring Manager for #oCov2fwh: Senior Program Manager, Property Data

After leading cross-functional projects at F5 for over 10 years, I'm ready to drive success with the team running the backbone of Zillow's business.  My expertise is in transforming abstract visions into concrete actions that deliver results, and I'm ready to bring this to your team.

I can wrangle the data and analyze the geeky details that engineers live for, and communicate them in terms of business value to an executive audience.  I'm most proud when the technology I've helped build enhances people's lives in some way.

Moving fast and thinking big, Spencer and the Zillow team have redefined visibility and what it means to have a sense of mission and contribution in the workplace.  I have a deep desire to jump in and own my part in bringing as much information as possible into the light for everyone to benefit from.

I'd love to talk with you more about the role.  You can get in touch with me at me@garybgenett.net or 206-391-6606.
